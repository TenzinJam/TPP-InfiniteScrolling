This project is build from scratch and not built on templates using create-react-app cli

Also, the components are not only modular at the "Pins" level, but also at individual "Pin" level, so that if you are to create a pin's page, you can do so directly. At the moment, the props passed into "Pin" are images but you are pass the entire pin properties as well so that a pin page can render any information related to that particulate pin as you desire.

App styling includes vanilla CSS and mostly Material UI components and properties.
